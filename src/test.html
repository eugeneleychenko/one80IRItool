    <p><strong>Important Risk Information</strong></p><br>

    <p><strong>What is SLYND?</strong></p>
    <p>
      SLYND is a birth control pill (oral contraceptive) that is used by females
      who can become pregnant to prevent pregnancy.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      The progestin drospirenone may increase potassium levels in your blood.
      You should not take SLYND if you have kidney, liver or adrenal disease
      because this could cause serious heart problems as well as other health
      problems. Other medicines may also increase potassium levels in your
      blood. If you are currently on daily, long-term treatment for a chronic
      health condition with any of the medicines listed below, talk to your
      healthcare provider about whether SLYND is right for you. If you take any
      of the medicines listed below for a chronic health condition you should have a blood test to check the potassium level in your blood before you start taking SLYND and during the first month that you take SLYND.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>medicines to treat fungal infections, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or voriconazole</li>
      <li>medicines to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection or Hepatitis C infection, such as indinavir or boceprevir</li>
      <li>clarithromycin</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Do not take SLYND if you:</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li>have kidney disease or kidney failure.</li>
      <li>have reduced adrenal gland function.</li>
      <li>have or have had cervical cancer or any cancer that is sensitive to female hormones</li>
      <li>have liver disease, including liver tumors.</li>
        <li>have unexplained vaginal bleeding.
        </li>
        </ul>
      Tell your healthcare providers if you have or have had any of these conditions. Your healthcare provider can suggest a different method of birth control.
    <br><br><strong>If any of these conditions happen while you are taking SLYND, stop taking SLYND right away and talk to your healthcare provider. Use non-hormonal contraception when you stop taking SLYND.</strong>
<br><br>
    <strong>Before you take SLYND, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.</li>
      <li>have ever had blood clots in your legs (deep vein thrombosis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or a stroke or heart attack (myocardial infarction).</li>
      <li>have or have had depression.
      </li>
  </ul>  
  <br>
  <strong>Tell your healthcare providers about all the medicines you take </strong>including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements, such as St. Johnâ€™s Wort. SLYND may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how well SLYND works.
