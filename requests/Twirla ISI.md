# INDICATION AND USAGE

TWIRLA is indicated as a method of contraception for use in women of reproductive potential with a BMI <30 kg/m² for whom a combined hormonal contraceptive is appropriate.

*Limitations of Use*:

Consider the reduced effectiveness of TWIRLA in women with a BMI ≥25 to <30 kg/m² before prescribing TWIRLA. TWIRLA is contraindicated in women with a BMI ≥30 kg/m².

# IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

## CONTRAINDICATIONS

TWIRLA is contraindicated and should not be used in women who have or develop the following conditions:

- At high risk of arterial or venous thromboembolic events, including smoke (if over age 35); have current or history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; have cerebrovascular disease; have coronary artery disease; have thrombogenic valvular or thrombogenic rhythm diseases of the heart; have inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathies; have uncontrolled hypertension with vascular disease; have diabetes mellitus and are over age 35, diabetes mellitus with hypertension or vascular disease or other end-organ damage, or diabetes mellitus of > 20 years duration

- Headaches with focal neurological symptoms, migraine with aura

- Women over 35 years of age with any migraine headache

- BMI ≥30 kg/m²

- Liver tumors, acute viral hepatitis, or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis, or liver disease

- Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding

- Pregnancy

- Current or history of breast cancer

- Hypersensitivity to any components of TWIRLA

- Use of Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir.

## WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

### Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Conditions

Women are at increased risk for a venous thromboembolic event (VTE) when using TWIRLA:

- Stop TWIRLA if an arterial or VTE occurs.

- Stop TWIRLA if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.

- Discontinue TWIRLA during prolonged immobilization and, if feasible, stop TWIRLA at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery.

- Start TWIRLA no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery in women who are not breast-feeding.

- Before starting TWIRLA, evaluate any past medical history or family history of thromboembolism or thromboembolic disorders and consider whether history suggests inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathy.

*Arterial Events*: CHCs increase the risk of cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, particularly among older women (>35 years of age), smokers, and women with hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or obesity.

*Venous Events*: The use of CHCs increase the risk of VTEs. Risk factors include, smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of CHCs.

### Liver Disease

- **Elevated Liver Enzymes**: Discontinue TWIRLA if jaundice develops. Acute liver test abnormalities may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until the liver tests return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded.

- **Liver Tumors**: CHCs increase the risk of hepatic adenomas. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death from abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) CHC users.

### Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment

Discontinue TWIRLA prior to starting therapy with the hepatitis C combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir. TWIRLA can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with that combination drug regimen.

### Additional Warnings and Precautions

- **Hypertension**: Monitor blood pressure at routine visits and stop TWIRLA if blood pressure rises significantly.

- **Gallbladder Disease**: Studies suggest CHCs increase the risk of developing gallbladder disease.

- **Adverse Metabolic Effects**:
  - Hyperglycemia: Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women.
  - Dyslipidemia: Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia.

- **Headache**: Evaluate and potentially discontinue if new headaches are recurrent, persistent, or severe.

- **Bleeding Irregularities**:
  - Unscheduled bleeding may occur, especially in the first 3 months.
  - Amenorrhea may occur even if not pregnant.

## ADVERSE REACTIONS

Serious adverse reactions (in <1% of women) include:
- Cholelithiasis
- Cholecystitis
- Major depression
- Suicidal ideation
- Appendicitis
- Ectopic pregnancy
- Pneumonia
- Gastroenteritis

Most common adverse reactions (≥2%):
- Application site disorders
- Nausea
- Headache
- Dysmenorrhea
- Increased weight

**Note**: TWIRLA does not protect against HIV or other sexually transmitted infections.

## DRUG INTERACTIONS

Drugs or herbal products that induce enzyme inducers may decrease TWIRLA's effectiveness. Use backup contraception when taking enzyme inducers.

## USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

- Reduces milk production in breastfeeding women
- Not indicated for females before menarche or postmenopausal women
