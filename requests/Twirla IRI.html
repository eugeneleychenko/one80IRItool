<h2>What is TWIRLA?</h2>
<p>TWIRLA is a birth control patch for women with Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who can become pregnant. It contains two female hormones, a progestin called levonorgestrel, and an estrogen called ethinyl estradiol. Birth control methods that have both an estrogen and progestin are called combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs).</p>

<p>TWIRLA is less effective in women with a BMI of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or more.</p>
