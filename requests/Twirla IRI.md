**What is TWIRLA?  
**TWIRLA is a birth control patch for women with Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who can become pregnant. It contains two female hormones, a progestin called levonorgestrel, and an estrogen called ethinyl estradiol. Birth control methods that have both an estrogen and progestin are called combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs).

TWIRLA is less effective in women with a BMI of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or more.

**Important Risk Information**
